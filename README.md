## Voice-First CRM Feature

The app now includes a voice-first CRM feature that allows Johnny (admin) to add voice notes for existing users. Here's how it works:

1. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard
2. Find the user you want to add information about
3. Click the "Record Voice Note" button
4. Speak naturally about the person, for example: "Marianne is a dentist from Ohio and I met her at a bar last night"
5. Click "Stop Recording" when finished
6. The system will automatically:
   - Transcribe the audio using OpenAI's Whisper API
   - Extract key information like occupation, location, and meeting details
   - Save the information to the user's profile
   - Add a new note with the transcription and extracted data

### Setting Up Voice-First CRM

To use this feature, you need to:

1. Add API keys to your `.env.local` file:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_generative_ai_key_here
   ```

2. Make sure your Firebase service account key is properly set up for server-side operations
   ```
   FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY={"type":"service_account",...}
   ```

### Technologies Used

The voice-first CRM feature uses:
- OpenAI's Whisper API for speech-to-text
- Google's Gemini AI for entity extraction
- Firebase for data storage and retrieval
- Next.js API routes for server-side processing
