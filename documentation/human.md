# Human: A Movement for the Age of AI

## Our Vision
In an era where artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming our world, Human exists to help people reconnect with their fundamental humanity and divine essence. We're not just preparing for the future – we're creating a movement that helps people thrive through the technological singularity by becoming more human, not less.

## The Challenge
As AI and automation continue to reshape our society, many people define their worth through their professional capabilities or specific skills. But what happens when these roles become automated? The answer isn't to compete with AI, but to rediscover what makes us uniquely, sacredly human.
